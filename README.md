# Probabilistic Programming

This repository explores the intersection of **symbolic execution** and **probabilistic programming**, providing tools and examples to compute probabilities over program paths, simulate randomized algorithms, and analyze program behavior with uncertain inputs.

## Project Overview

The project takes a **random input program**, converts it into **symbolic execution** in a simplified `pWhile` syntax, and calculates **branch probabilities** using probabilistic analysis.

Later, these **branch probabilities** are tested using the **PRISM model checker** by taking the relevant properties from each example and verifying them for correctness and behavior under uncertainty.
